The goal of this project is to provide an api, webpage, and mobile application allow users to send files of arbitrary size to each other.

THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE WORK IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW.

As such, it makes little sense to write a proper readme right now.

NEVERTHELESS

#Documentation:

This project should allow users to share files directly and legally where they have connections to the intermediate server.

What is done:
There's a server and CGo, Web Broser WASM build, Native Go client that work well with each other over my local address that's saddly looped back.
